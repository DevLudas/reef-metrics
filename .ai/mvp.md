# Application - ReefMetrics (MVP)

## Main problem

Gathering in one place, entered by the user, the most important water parameters in a marine aquarium. Additionally, subjecting them to analysis against optimal values. In the event of a deviation from the optimal values, there should be an assessment of their impact on marine life, and proposed corrective actions should be provided.

## Minimum feature set

- A user account system with a profile.
- The ability to add one’s own marine aquarium to the system along with a description.
- Adding the current values of the most important water parameters in a marine aquarium to the aquarium via a form.
- An AI assessment of parameter values and proposed corrective actions for parameters that deviate from optimal.
- A simple and readable dashboard to present the most recently entered results.

## Out of scope for MVP

- Uploading measurements from a CSV file.
- A chart presenting a selected parameter or set of parameters over a selected time range.
- Sharing results with other users.
- Generating a PDF report with a summary of the selected sample.
- A mobile application.

## Success criteria

- 90% of users have a completed profile with their own aquarium added along with a description.
- 75% of users add their measurements once per week.
