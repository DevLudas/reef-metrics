# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - ReefMetrics

## 1. Product Overview

ReefMetrics is a web application targeted at marine aquarium hobbyists. Its main goal is to centralize the process of monitoring water parameters in an aquarium. The application allows users to manually enter test results for seven key parameters, analyze them against predefined or personalized optimal values, and offers support in the form of AI-generated recommendations when abnormalities are detected.

## 2. User Problem

Marine aquarists must regularly monitor water parameters to ensure the health and stability of their ecosystem. Currently, this process is fragmented – data is often recorded in physical notebooks, spreadsheets, or in memory, making it difficult to track trends and quickly identify problems. There is a lack of one dedicated tool that not only aggregates historical data but also actively supports the user in interpreting it. Users need a platform that compares their results with optimal values, visually signals deviations, and provides general guidance on corrective actions, significantly simplifying aquarium management.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### User and Profile Management

- Users can create an account in the system using an email address and password.
- The system provides mechanisms for logging in, logging out, and password reset.
- After logging in, users can add one or more aquariums to their profile.
- Each aquarium has a name, type (e.g., LPS, SPS, fish only), and description.
- Users can edit and delete existing aquariums.

### Parameters and Measurements Management

- The application tracks 7 key parameters: salinity (SG), carbonate hardness (kH), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphates (PO4), nitrates (NO3), and temperature.
- The application provides default, editable optimal values for each aquarium type.
- Users can enter new measurement sets through a simple form.
- Each entry is automatically timestamped (date and time).
- Users can edit and delete previously entered measurements.
- Data validation at the MVP level is limited to checking data types (e.g., whether the value is a number).

### Dashboard and Data Visualization

- The main dashboard displays the last recorded measurement set by default.
- When multiple aquariums are present, users can easily switch between them using a dropdown list.
- For each parameter, a separate panel is displayed that contains the current value, target value, and color-coded status indicator:
  - Green: deviation below 10% from the optimal value.
  - Orange: deviation between 10% and 20%.
  - Red: deviation above 20%.
- The dashboard includes a calendar element that allows navigation and display of historical measurements.
- For new users who have not yet added any measurements, the dashboard displays a message encouraging them to add their first entry.

### Analysis and AI Recommendations

- After clicking on a parameter panel, users are presented with analysis and corrective suggestions generated by AI.
- Recommendations are general in nature and do not promote specific commercial products.
- Each AI-generated suggestion is clearly marked as a recommendation, accompanied by a disclaimer stating that the final decision and responsibility for its implementation rests with the user.

## 4. Product Boundaries

The following functionalities are not within the scope of the MVP version and may be considered in future product iterations:

- Import of measurement data from external files (e.g., CSV).
- Generation of charts showing parameter value changes over time.
- Social features, such as sharing results with other users.
- Exporting reports and summaries to PDF format.
- Dedicated mobile application (the MVP version product is a web application).
- Integration with external analytics tools for tracking metrics (success measurement will be performed through direct database queries).

### Adoption

- Goal: 90% of registered users have at least one fully configured aquarium (with name and type) in the system.
- Measurement method: SQL query comparing the number of users with at least one aquarium to the total number of registered users.

### Retention

- Goal: 75% of active users (logging in at least once a week) add new measurements at least once a week.
- Measurement method: SQL query analyzing timestamps of added measurements for each user at specified time intervals.
