# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - ReefMetrics
## 1. Product Overview
ReefMetrics is a web application MVP (Minimum Viable Product) designed for marine aquarium hobbyists. Its main goal is to centralize the process of monitoring water parameters in a single place. The app allows users to manually enter test results for seven key parameters, analyze them against predefined or personalized optimal values, and receive AI-generated recommendations when abnormalities are detected.

## 2. User Problem
Marine aquarists must regularly monitor water chemistry to ensure the health and stability of their ecosystems. Currently, this process is fragmented—data are often recorded in notebooks, spreadsheets, or remembered, making trend tracking and problem detection difficult. There is no dedicated tool that aggregates historical data and actively supports users in interpreting them. Users need a platform that compares their results against optimal values, visually highlights deviations, and provides actionable insights for corrective measures, simplifying aquarium management.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### User and Profile Management
- Users can create an account using an email and password.
- The system provides login, logout, and password reset mechanisms.
- After logging in, users can add one or more aquariums to their profile.
- Each aquarium has a name, type (e.g., LPS, SPS, fish-only), and description.
- Users can edit and delete existing aquariums.

### Parameter and Measurement Management
- The app tracks 7 key parameters: salinity (SG), carbonate hardness (kH), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphates (PO4), nitrates (NO3), and temperature.
- The app provides default, editable optimal values for each aquarium type.
- Users can input new sets of measurements using a simple form.
- Each record is automatically timestamped with date and time.
- Users can edit and delete previously entered measurements.
- Data validation in the MVP version is limited to verifying the data type (e.g., if the value is numeric).

### Dashboard and Data Visualization
- The main dashboard displays the most recent measurement by default.
- For users with multiple aquariums, a dropdown menu allows easy switching between tanks.
- Each parameter has a dedicated panel showing the current value, target value, and color-coded status indicator:
    - Green: deviation below 10% of optimal value
    - Orange: deviation between 10%–20%
    - Red: deviation above 20%
- The dashboard includes a calendar component for navigating and displaying historical measurements.
- New users with no data see a message encouraging them to add their first measurement.

### AI Analysis and Recommendations
- Clicking on a parameter panel displays an analysis and corrective actions generated by AI.
- Recommendations are general and do not promote commercial products.
- Each AI suggestion is clearly labeled as a recommendation with a disclaimer stating that implementation responsibility lies solely with the user.

## 4. Product Boundaries
The following features are outside the MVP scope but may be considered in future versions:
- Importing measurement data from external files (e.g., CSV).
- Generating charts showing parameter trends over time.
- Social features such as sharing results with other users.
- Exporting reports and summaries to PDF.
- Dedicated mobile application (MVP is a web-based product).
- Integration with external analytic tools (success tracking will rely on direct database queries).
